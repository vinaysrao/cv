\section{Course-work and relevant experience}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}
2012-13& \textbf{Bachelor's Thesis}\\ &\textsc{On the techniques and features for object recognition} \\&\footnotesize{Conducted research on various techniques used in computer vision for generic object recognition, and implemented several algorithms. Did a comparitive study of some older approaches such as using closed form representation of borders against newer methods that use tailored feature extractors (SURF/SIFT) with traditional classifiers, and classifiers that extract features automatically (such as convolutional networks). Implemented several algorithms and methods ground up using standard numerical libraries in C++ and Python.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
2012 &\textbf{Google Summer Of Code, Contract Developer}\\&\textsc{Save/load system for Gluon, KDE} \\&\footnotesize{Developed a generic persistent (GDL) game save and load system for Gluon (Game development engine). Implemented a system to maintain scene graphs and quickly translate states to serializable Javascript objects. Implemented a generic tagging system to guide game development, and worked on incremental save/loads that enabled smaller persistent files.} \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
